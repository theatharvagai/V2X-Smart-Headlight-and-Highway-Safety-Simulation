# 🌍 Overview

This project is a **real-time V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) Smart Highway Simulation** where multiple computers act as intelligent vehicles communicating over MQTT to create a cooperative, AI-driven transportation ecosystem.

Each node (computer) behaves like a car on a highway, sharing:
- Position 📍
- Speed 🚗
- Lane 🛣️
- Safety Alerts ⚠️  
in real-time through a live interactive dashboard.

Unlike traditional simulations, this system integrates **AI safety, intelligent routing, smart infrastructure, and distributed communication** into a single unified platform.
